I just finished 6 months of work at Groundlight AI, a startup working on hard problems in computer vision. 
Through my work, I came across literature on "robustness", the science of helping machine learning systems to avoid
their natural tendency to be lazy learners. Sometimes, models will learn to focus on whatever pattern is easiest to pick out,
regardless of whether the pattern actually corresponds to the informative features us humans use to make decisions.

This is a well-documented phenomenon across most disciplines of ML.  For instance, it turns out that many classifiers trained on the famous ImageNet dataset exhibit a serious bias towards [making decisions based on the texture of an object](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12231.pdf), 
even when the texture and shape of the object conflict. This work inspired me to enter the ECCV 2022 Out-of-Distribution Computer Vision
(OOD-CV) pose estimation challenge, and [I ended up being a finalist!](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/6783#results)

I'm also in the last year of my bachelor's degree at Harvey Mudd College, where I'm studying math and computer science. Moving forward, 
I'm looking for opportunities to expand my ML skillset and gain experience building complex systems in the real world.
